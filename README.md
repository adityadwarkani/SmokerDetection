Smoker detection through image classification plays a crucial role in various domains such as public health and surveillance. 
This project aims at thoroughly analyzing image datasets to classify images into two categories namely ‘Smoker’ and ‘Non-Smoker’.
In order to determine which machine learning algorithm works best for this image classification task, the model investigates the use of several machine learning algorithms.
The algorithms used are namely Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Random Forests, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Naive Bayes.
These algorithms are compared with the help of confusion matrices and classification reports. 
The project is structured to provide a detailed understanding of the methodology, experimental setup, and the results obtained from each algorithm. 
Ultimately, the goal of this project is to create a model that can effectively distinguish between smokers and non smokers.
